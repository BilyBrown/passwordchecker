This is a password checker.
You can use it in the terminal. Type your passwords after the program name to check how often they show up in an online password database of compromised passwords.

example:

>> python3 checkmypass.py password123 hello beautiful

This script will tell you how many times that password shows up in the pwnedpasswords database.
